What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.

3. Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.
Miles per gallon
A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. If a car typically gets 20 mpg, and if you input 10 gallons of gasoline, it will be able to travel roughly 200 miles. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors.
