Creating Hyperlinks
To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element? 
<a>
The href attribute contains what information?
For <a> and <area> elements, the href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.
For <base> elements, the href attribute specifies the base URL for all relative URLs on a page.
For <link> elements, the href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource (most often a style sheet file).
What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
Use concise and meaningful text for links.
Do not capitalize all letters in links.
Avoid using URLs for link text.
Do not use the word "link" as part of the link text.
Do not use tooltips/screentips to add additional information.

CSS Layout
CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning
What is meant by “normal flow”?
the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout
What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
___ positioning is the default for every html element.
Static
Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
Aside from a few IE bugs, very good cross-browser support.
Less dependence on floats, which can be problematic.
Less dependence on margins, which can be a bit buggy in older IE.
What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
Absolutely positioned elements are positioned with respect to a containing block, which is the nearest postioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block.
Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewport—the viewport is always their containing block.

Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code
Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
The difference lies in how the browser loads them into the execution context. Function declarations load before any code is executed. Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code.
What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
Parameter is the variable in the declaration of the function.
Argument is the actual value of this variable that gets passed to the function.
