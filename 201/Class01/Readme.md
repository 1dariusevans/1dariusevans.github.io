Topic: How the Web works?
Computers connected to the internet are called clients and servers.
Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices
Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps.

Topic: Javascript
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages.
The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like:

Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.
Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris".
