Domain Modeling
Explain why we need domain modeling.
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
HTML Table Basics
Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
Because they are Difficult for screen readers to differentiate
List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
The <section> HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. 
The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS.
Introducing Constructors
What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
Object instances have a "type" i.e. you can check instanceof or constructor to make decisions given just an object instance.
The most important of all, you get encapsulation. …
Using a constructor is more concise and more conventional than instantiating a generic object first and tacking on properties.
How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**
Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
JavaScript inheritance is more widely known as “prototypal inheritance.” Prototypal inheritance uses the concept of prototype chaining, and it refers to the linking of objects via the prototype property.
