Topic: Wireframe and Design

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

How is wireframe created?
Some people like to draw their wireframes by hand, others feel more comfortable using software like Invision, or Balsamiq to create theirs. It’s important to emphasize that how you make yours is up to you.

For complete beginners, bear in mind the following when deciding on your wireframe creation process:

*Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
*With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
*Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

Here are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:

Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
Sketch > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code
