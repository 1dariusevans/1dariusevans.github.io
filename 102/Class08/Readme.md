Topic:Expressions and operators

What is an expression?
An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

Ex: The expression x = 7 or The expression 3 + 4

Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. 

Destructing
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.
